# Svelte + Vite + Tailwind 

This template is designed to streamline your Svelte development process within the Vite ecosystem.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimized development experience, utilize [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [Svelte extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Why Choose This Template?

- **Efficiency:** Jumpstart your Svelte projects swiftly with pre-configured settings.
- **Flexibility:** Unlike SvelteKit, this template offers a minimalistic approach, leaving routing preferences to the developer.
- **Seamless Integration:** Benefit from Vite's rapid build tool without the overhead of a full-fledged framework.

## Technical Insights

**Routing Considerations:**

- While SvelteKit imposes its routing solution, this template lets developers choose their preferred method.
- It mirrors SvelteKit's structure for easy migration, ensuring scalability as projects evolve.

**TypeScript Configuration:**

- Instead of limiting type options with `compilerOptions.types`, this template uses triple-slash references to maintain workspace-wide type inference.

**VS Code Extensions:**

- By including `.vscode/extensions.json`, users are prompted to install recommended extensions upon project opening, enhancing development workflows.

**Type Checking in JavaScript:**

- Enabling `checkJs` offers advanced type checking by default, providing insights into potential runtime type issues.

**HMR Considerations:**

- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) state preservation can lead to unexpected behavior and is disabled by default. External stores are recommended for retaining component state.

## Sveltify

Created with the aim of optimizing development time, this template simplifies Svelte project setup. With pre-configured Svelte, Vite, and Tailwind CSS settings, getting started is effortless.
